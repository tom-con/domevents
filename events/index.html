      <p>Once upon a time, a little under two weeks ago, twenty-nine <span class="plnoun1"></span> put a hold on their lives and dedicated the next six months to become full-stack <span class="plnoun2"></span>. All of them believed with <span class="number1"></span>% confidence that making this change would really boost them to the next level. Over the next few months, they would all get to know each other really well...maybe too well... They would learn on day 54 that <span class="student1"></span> was a <span class="occupation"></span> two years prior. During Q3 projects, it would be revealed that <span class="student2"></span> secretly enjoys <span class="hobby"></span>. Not only would surprising and intimate facts would be revealed about the students of g44, but also about the instructors. Craig, in another life, battled with <span class="fiction"></span> and lost. It was through this crushing defeat that he learned about grit. g44 would learn that Pete's wardrobe aesthetic is actually based on a combination of fashion inspired by <span class="celeb1"></span>, <span class="celeb2"></span>, and <span class="celeb3"></span>...aaanddd that Lisa was exactly what everyone expected her be - the best instructor whose soul was made of rainbows and unicorns. g44 would go on to become the best full-stack <span class="plnoun2"></span> in all the land. The End.</p>
